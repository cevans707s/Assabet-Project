                <h3>Overview</h3>
                Many different kinds of recreational activities are welcome in the Refuge, and all visitors are encouraged to be aware of and respect others, whatever their pursuits.
                <br>
                <br>
                Within the refuge, watercraft and boating are only permitted on the Assebet River.  All other bodies of water in the refuge prohibit watercraft.
                <br>
                <a id="Hiking"></a>
                <br>
                Please note that swimming and ice skating are prohibited in all bodies of water in the Refuge.
                <br>
                <h3>Hiking</h3>
                The Refuge has over 15 miles of trails for walking and hiking. 
                These trails range are a mix of rugged trails and former military tracks, which are broad and flat, with some occasional sections of old pavement.
                Most of the trails feature relatively gentle grades. Many of the trails near the ponds and wetlands are prone to flooding, though some sections have bridges and boardwalks.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the safety of the public and wildlife, and to prevent erosion,
                Refuge guidelines require visitors to remain on existing trails and to refrain from making new trails or attempting to create bridges over flooded sections.
                <br>
                <br>
                To plan your hike, please see the trail map in the trail and recreation guide.
