                The first human inhabitants of the lands that now make up the Assabet River Wildlife Refuge were 
                Native Americans of the Nipmuc, Massachussett, and Wampanoag peoples. These peoples lived and fished in the area for generations.
                <br>
                <br>
                With the arrival of English colonists in the 1600's conflict arose which culminated in what is known as King Philip's War.
                After this conflict, the Native peoples were displaced and the English colonists transformed the area into a prosperous farmland.
                <br>
                <br>
                Many different farming families lived in the area, but with the onset of World War II, the United States government appropriated the land
                to create the Fort Devens Sudbury Training Annex.  The descendents of the colonists who displaced the Native Americans were themselves displaced.
                The military continued to use the land for the remainder of the 20th century, both as an ammunition depot and training area for troops.

                <br>
                In 2000, the Army transferred over 2300 acres to the Fish and Wildlife Service and the current Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge was created.
                While the area has rapidly been reclaimed by nature, many signs of past human inhabitants remain - from colonial stone walls to raised causeways and bunkers from the Army years.
